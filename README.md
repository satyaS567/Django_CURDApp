# django_curdapp
Curdapp is a web application built using Django, Bootstrap 5, and SQLite3 that allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a simple database. Key Features:

User Authentication and Access Control: Curdapp incorporates user authentication, allowing users to register, log in, and log out securely. Different user roles can be defined, granting varying levels of access and control over the data.

Create: Users can easily add new data entries through a well-designed form interface. Read: Data can be displayed in a tabular format, with options for sorting, filtering, and pagination for better organization. Update: Users can edit existing data entries, and the changes are reflected in real-time. Delete: Unwanted data entries can be deleted effortlessly, with confirmation prompts to prevent accidental deletions. Responsive UI Design: Curdapp uses Bootstrap 5 to ensure a responsive and visually appealing user interface across different devices and screen sizes. This enhances the user experience and accessibility.

Database Management: SQLite3, a lightweight and serverless database engine, is used as the backend database for Curdapp. It simplifies the setup process and makes the application easy to deploy without requiring a separate database server.

Intuitive Data Visualization: The application could incorporate basic data visualization features, such as graphs and charts, to provide users with a visual representation of the data they manage.
